// UserInterest table ✅
// Comment create, get ✅
// Report table create, update and get ticket ✅
// Notification table get ✅

// TODO next
// Announcement create trigger notification to every user. ✅
// System randomly pick a review from the mod user pool (considering not implementing it ✅). ⏰
// Post search fetch ⏰
// Post that match user interest category fetch. ⏰

// ⏰ is postponed until the team decide on the following. [DECIDED ON EVERYTHING]
// 1. Is the report reviewer really matter? Projection: Reviewer is highly unlikely to be necessary.
// 2. Do we make the title field separately when creating a post? (Now, the title is the first line of the post content.) Projection: Highly likely to add title field.
// 3. Does the search render real-time on what is actually on the frontend? Projection: idk.
// Like, do we match the keyword in the search box to any component of the post, if at least one match, show the post. The post only included the rendered/fetched one from the database and saved state on the frontend.
// The search happen every time the keyword changes.
